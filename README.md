The following package is basically used to get the bar graph from a csv file,
which then is converted to json and is fed as input to D3.js for the graph formation.

Here we have csv file named country_details.csv which is specified on line 7 of the file csvJson.js
Now,in order to plot the graph,we have distributed the csv into 3 json files,each corresponding to specific purpose.

The csv file is already added to the root folder.In order to add another csv file,just replace the already added file
to get the corresponding csv.

3 different json files have been created and been used for plotting 3 different graphs.
